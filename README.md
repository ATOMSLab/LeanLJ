# LeanMD

LeanMD stands for Lean Molecular Dynamics. It is a project that brings mathematical accuracy and reliability to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. 
It is built using the Lean Functional Programming Language and Theorem Prover. LeanMD aims to make scientific software provable by ensuring every 
calculation and simulation step is grounded in proven mathematics. The vision behind LeanMD is to help scientists and researchers run simulations 
they can fully trust, knowing that each part has been rigorously checked for correctness.

## Goals of LeanMD
+ ***Mathematically Verified Simulations:*** LeanMD’s core focus is on verifying every calculation involved in MD simulations, including foundational
equations like Newton's laws of motion and energy conservation. Unlike conventional simulations, which rely on approximations, LeanMD formalizes these
equations in Lean, ensuring each step adheres strictly to mathematical principles. This precision greatly reduces the risk of computational errors, leading
to more reliable simulation results.

+ ***Provable Scientific Computing:*** LeanMD provides a framework to prevent the typical errors arising from approximations, coding bugs, or oversight.
Inspired by the precise methods used in fields like chip manufacturing, LeanMD’s system checks each step of the simulation for correctness, creating
simulations that are as free from errors as possible. This is particularly valuable for complex molecular systems where accuracy is essential.

+ ***Supporting Education and Research:*** LeanMD isn’t just a tool—it’s also a resource for students and researchers learning about the importance of
verified computing. Through its open-source library, LeanMD offers access to verified scientific theorems that anyone can use and learn from. This educational focus helps expand Lean’s impact, encouraging a culture of learning and collaboration among researchers and students alike.

+ ***Automation with AI:*** Looking to the future, LeanMD plans to incorporate AI tools, such as large language models (LLMs), to help automate some of the more complex proof steps. This addition could make it faster and easier to explore new scientific theories, validate findings, and possibly even generate new insights automatically. By integrating AI, LeanMD aims to keep up with the latest advancements, making proof generation and validation quicker and more efficient.

## Impact and Vision
LeanMD is setting a new standard in molecular dynamics simulations by ensuring that each simulation is backed by solid, error-checked mathematics. By 
creating a trustworthy, verified approach to scientific computing, LeanMD is helping researchers run simulations confidently. LeanMD aims to improve the 
quality and reliability of scientific software, paving the way for discoveries grounded in accurate, proven calculations.
