--# Theorem to show that applying PBC to each position individually gives the same squared distance
/-
This theorem asserts that the minimum image distance between two positions posA and posB in a periodic box
can be calculated equivalently in two ways:
By directly computing the minimum image distance for the box size, or
By first applying periodic boundary conditions (PBC) to both positions and then computing the minimum image
distance. In other words, the order of applying PBC—either before or during the computation of distances—
does not affect the final result.
